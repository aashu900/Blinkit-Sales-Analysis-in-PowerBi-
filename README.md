# HR-Analytics-in-PowerBi-


## Objective
The main goal of this HR Analytics project is to analyze employee data to gain insights that can help improve decision-making in areas like employee retention, performance, hiring, and satisfaction. Using Power BI, I built a dashboard that visualizes key HR metrics in an interactive and easy-to-understand way.

## Tools Used
Microsoft Power BI

Microsoft Excel (for data cleaning and preparation)

## Step-by-Step Process
1. Data Collection
   Collected HR-related data including employee age, department, job role, education, experience, attrition, etc.
   
   Used a sample dataset (can be from Kaggle or any HR system).
   
2. Data Cleaning
   Checked for missing values and removed duplicates.
   
   Corrected data types (e.g., converting dates, numbers).
   
   Removed irrelevant columns.

3. Data Transformation
   Created new calculated columns (e.g., age group, total working years).
   
   Created measures using DAX for KPIs like attrition rate, average salary, and satisfaction level.

4. Dashboard Creation
   Designed multiple visuals such as:
   
   Attrition by Department
   
   Job Satisfaction Level
   
   Average Salary by Job Role
   
   Years at Company vs Performance
   
   Used slicers and filters for user interaction (e.g., by gender, department, education).

5. Insights & Analysis
   Analyzed which departments have higher attrition.
   
   Identified job roles with low satisfaction.
   
   Studied the relationship between experience and performance.

## Key Results
   Found that Sales Department has the highest attrition rate.
   
   Employees with less than 3 years of experience tend to leave more often.
   
   Job satisfaction and monthly income are closely linked to retention.
   
   Identified that mid-level employees show the best performance scores.

## What I Learned
   How to clean and prepare HR data effectively in Excel and Power BI.
   
   Built DAX measures for deep-level insights.
   
   Designed a professional-level interactive dashboard.
   
   Understood how analytics can help HR teams take better people-related decisions.
   
   Improved storytelling skills through visualizations.

## How This Report Can Help
   Helps HR managers track key employee metrics in real-time.
   
   Supports decisions in hiring, promotions, and employee engagement.
   
   Identifies areas of improvement to reduce attrition and increase satisfaction.

## Files Included

   HR_Data.xlsx - Cleaned and prepared dataset.
   
   README.md - This documentation file.

## Conclusion
This HR Analytics dashboard provides a smart, data-driven way to understand workforce trends. With Power BI, we can visualize patterns and take actions that improve both employee experience and business performance.
